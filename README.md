# Please go through main class for an overview of solution.

# Since the task mention to avoid "A web, desktop, command line or any other kind of app", the solution just contains a Cart service that performs the required task

# The unit tests cover and explain the responsibility of each class (except DTOs)

# As there was no mention of how a cart is associated to a user, I have assumed one cart per user.

# I would like to highlight that this is a high level solution of given problem solved without using any available framework. 
# There is scope to add multiple features like authentication, persistence, etc which have not been considered as part of solution.
